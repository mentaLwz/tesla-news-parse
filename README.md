You're right, and I apologize for not addressing this in my previous response. Parsing web content universally is a challenging task because websites have different structures and content layouts. There isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, but there are some approaches that can work reasonably well for many websites:

1. Content Extraction Libraries: Libraries like goose3 (Python) or newspaper (Python) are designed to extract the main content from web pages. While these are Python libraries, you could potentially use them via a Python script called from Go, or look for similar Go libraries.
2. Readability Algorithms: Implementations of readability algorithms like Mozilla's Readability.js can be effective. There are Go ports of this algorithm, such as go-readability.
3. HTML Parsing with Heuristics: This involves parsing the HTML and using heuristics to identify the main content. It's more complex but can be customized for your needs.

4. Machine Learning Approaches: More advanced solutions use machine learning to identify main content, but this requires training data and more complex implementation.
   For a Go-based solution, let's implement a simple heuristic approach. This won't be perfect, but it can serve as a starting point:
